### Work In Progress

I'm going through this sequence of [Flutter](
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-flutter)  [tutorials](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-102-flutter) in order, using ClojureDart instead of Dart.

### Status

I've finished the [mdc-101-flutter](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-101-flutter) tutorial.

* The `Next` button works: The home page opens with the `You did it!` text.
* [This sample](https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart/tree/b56635cb8b7aca53bf6ee530ab03cf5bbd5e445e/samples/navigate_named_routes) helped me sort out the routes.
