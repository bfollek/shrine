### FAQ

#### Q: When I build on a Mac, I get a bunch of warnings about a capability. What's wrong?

A: Nothing's wrong. It's an [OS X/XCode problem](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/737923). You can ignore it. Hopefully it disappears in a later version of XCode.

The warnings look like this:

```
